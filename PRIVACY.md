# Markdown Diagrams Privacy Policy
No personal data is collected by the extension. 
The extension just scans the page for any known diagrams, so he code block of the found diagrams is encoded and sent to a server to obtain its graphic form.
No other data is used or sent - all the code is open source and inspectable.

## Security of data contained in diagrams
By default the extension sends diagrams to the free public cloud instance https://kroki.io; normally this is not a security issue, but you can still install Kroki on your own personal infrastructure (and change extension config).
In the extension settings you can however set a deny-list of sites, in which the extension will be kept deactivated.
